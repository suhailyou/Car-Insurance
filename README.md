This project is a native desktop-based car insurance management system designed to streamline the process of applying for and processing car insurance applications. It consists of three key user roles: the Client, the Admin, 
and the Insurance Officer, each with distinct functionalities.
The Client is responsible for applying for car insurance by filling out necessary details and uploading all required documents related to the vehicle.
The Admin has full access to all client data, including submitted documents and application details. The admin can manage records, monitor the system, and ensure smooth workflow between users.
The Insurance Officer reviews each client application and makes the final decision to approve or reject the insurance claim based on the provided documentation and eligibility criteria.
From a technical perspective, the application is built using Java for its object-oriented structure and multi-platform compatibility, allowing the system to run on different operating systems seamlessly.
Java Server Pages (JSP) were used to create dynamic web interfaces for both the client and admin modules, enabling real-time updates and interactions.
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) were integrated to allow communication with external services and to efficiently handle and process client data.
This project offers a scalable and secure solution for managing insurance processes and can be extended in the future with features like automated decision-making, real-time notifications, 
and integration with government databases for document verification.
